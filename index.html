    <h1><a href="">Wikipedia Night Mode</a></h1>
    <p>
      The short answer is yes and no! The rise of the dark mode is somewhat
      recent trend and big organizations are slower to adjust. Thus we might
      expect Wikipedia to offer night mode throughout its apps and website, but
      not just yet. Here is a quick guide on the current status and what you can
      do to have night mode enabled everywhere. Þes, Wikipedia has built in
      night mode when it comes to its smarphone apps! Last year Wikipedia pushed
      updates to its Android and iOS apps and implemented night mode as s
      standard feature. Not only the whole UI can be switched to dark or black,
      but the app also allows you to dim the images. By doing that, Wikipedia is
      making the whole night mode experience more smooth and complete. “Dark
      mode! Read in comfort with new Appearance controls, including dark colors
      and image dimming. Make those late night Wikipedia sessions easier on the
      eyes.” No, the website offers no built-in night mode. You are on your own.
      Or… are you?
